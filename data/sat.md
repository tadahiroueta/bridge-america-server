# SAT 
*(Scholastic Assessment Test)* 

College Board's SAT is the most common standardised exam in American high schools, followed by its alternative, the ACT. 

The SAT is the single most important test for college admissions. So it is strongly advised to spend at least a couple weeks studying for it in advance. Many colleges, however, are test-blind or test-optional. 

Most students take the test in their Junior year of high school. 

This exam assesses your abilities in English and maths. 

The scores range from 400 to 1600, with roughly 1000 as the average score nationwide. Your English and maths scores (200-800) each contribute to half of your total score. 

The SAT takes 3 hours with breaks in between, and it consists of 154 multiple choice questions. 

Your high school will likely provide one free SAT, but there is no limit to how many times you can take it. It is offered 7 times a year, in multiple accessible locations, for $60 each.
